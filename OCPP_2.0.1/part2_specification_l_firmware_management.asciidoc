== Introduction

This Functional Block describes the functionality that enables a CSO to update the firmware of a Charging Station.

When a Charging Station needs to be updated with new firmware, the CSMS informs the Charging Station of the time at which the Charging Station can start downloading the new firmware. The Charging Station SHALL notify the CSMS after each step as it downloads and installs the new firmware.

**8 Remark(s)** As an example in this use case the requestId  123, but this could be any value.
Measures SHOULD be taken to secure the firmware when it is stored on a server or workstation.
The Charging Station has a required Configuration Variable that reports which file transfer
protocols it supports: FileTransferProtocols
When migrating to a new version of OCPP it is RECOMMENDED to install a fallback
NetworkConnectionProfile with the new configuration.
The requirements for the Firmware Signing Certificate are described in the: Certificate Properties
section.
The manufacturer SHALL NOT use intermediate certificates for the firmware signing certificate in
the Charging Station.

FirmwareStatusNotificationRequest
message to the CSMS with this new
status. What reason to use is
described in the description of
FirmwareStatusEnumType.
Edition 3 FINAL, 2024-05-06 **L. FirmwareManagement**



ID Precondition Requirement definition Note
L01.FR.02 When the Charging Station enters the
Invalid Certificate state in the
firmware process.


The Charging Station SHALL send a
SecurityEventNotificationRequest
message to the CSMS with the
security event
InvalidFirmwareSigningCertificate
(See part 2 appendices for the full list
of security events).
L01.FR.03 When the Charging Station enters the
Invalid Signature state.


The Charging Station SHALL send a
SecurityEventNotificationRequest
message to the CSMS with the
security event
InvalidFirmwareSignature (See part 2
appendices for the full list of security
events).
L01.FR.04 When the Charging Station has
successfully downloaded the new
firmware


The signature SHALL be validated, by
calculating the signature over the
entire firmware file using the RSA-PSS
or ECSchnorr algorithm for signing,
and the SHA256 algorithm for
calculating hash values.

L01.FR.05 L01.FR.04 AND
( _installDateTime_ is not set OR
current time > _installDateTime_ )
The Charging Station SHALL install
the new firmware as soon as it is able
to.

L01.FR.08 It is RECOMMENDED that the
firmware is sent encrypted to the
Charging Station. This can either be
done by using a secure protocol (such
as HTTPS, SFTP, or FTPS) to send the
firmware, or by encrypting the
firmware itself before sending it.
L01.FR.09 Firmware updates SHALL be digitally
protected to ensure authenticity and
to provide proof of origin.
This protection is achieved by
applying a digital signature over the
hash value of the firmware image.
Ideally, this signature is already
computed by the manufacturer. This
way proof of origin of the firmware
image can be tracked back to the
original author of the firmware.
L01.FR.10 Every
FirmwareStatusNotificationRequest
sent for a firmware update SHALL
contain the same requestId as the
UpdateFirmwareRequest that started
this firmware update.
L01.FR.11 For security purposes the CSMS
SHALL include the Firmware Signing
certificate (see Keys used in OCPP) in

(a) send an optional
FirmwareStatusNotificationRequest
with _status_  InstallRebooting
before rebooting and send a
mandatory
FirmwareStatusNotificationRequest
with _status_  Installed by the newly
activated firmware, or
(b) only send a
FirmwareStatusNotificationRequest
with status set to Installed without
reporting the reboot and activation of
the new firmware.
Option (a) is preferred, because it
notifies CSMS of an upcoming reboot
of the Charging Station, and the final
_status_  Installed is sent by the
new firmware image, so that CSMS
can be sure that the new firmware is
active. This is not guaranteed by
option (b) when rebooting of the new
firmware should fail.
L01.FR.33 L01.FR.05
AND
The Charging Station has ongoing
transactions
AND
a reboot is needed to activate the
installed firmware
