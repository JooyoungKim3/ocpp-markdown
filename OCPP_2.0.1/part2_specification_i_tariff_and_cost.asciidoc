= I. TariffAndCost

== 1. Introduction

This Functional Block provides tariff and cost information to an EV Driver, when a Charging Station is capable of showing this on a
display.

Before a driver starts charging he needs to be given tariff information, given detailed prices for all the components that make up the
tariff plan applicable to this driver at this Charging Station. As this is a human readable text message, it can also be used for other
things, like a personal welcome message.

Some business cases might require the EV Driver to be shown the running total cost during charging, updated at a regular, fitting
interval. When the EV Driver stops charging, he needs to be shown to the total cost of the just stopped transaction.

All tariffs and costs are in the currency configured in the Configuration Variable Currency.

=== 1.1. Why no structured tariff information?

Because tariff structures can become very complex it will be difficult to convert these to human-readable text in the Charging
Station. The CSO is the owner of the tariffs and should be able to provide the Charging Station with a human-readable tariff text. If
the CSO is not able to generate human-readable texts from its own tariffs, how can a Charging Station be expected to be able to
this. That is why we have kept the complexity of tariffs out of OCPP.

=== 2. Use cases & Requirements

==== I01 - Show EV Driver-specific Tariff Information


No. Type Description
1 Name Show EV Driver-specific Tariff Information
2 ID I01
Functional block I. Tariff and Cost
3 Objective(s) To show an EV Driver-specific tariff before the start of a transaction.
4 Description When an EV Driver wants to charge an EV he wants to know how much charging will cost him at
the Charging Station he is at. The EV Driver is authenticated by his (RFID) token. The Charging
Station asks the CSMS for information about the presented token. The CSMS returns information
about the token, including the tariff applicable to this EV Driver.
Actors Charging Station, CSMS, EV Driver

Scenario description (^) **1.** The EV Driver wants to charge an EV, he presents his IdTokenType.

**2.** The Charging Station sends AuthorizeRequest to the CSMS to request authorization.
**3.** Upon receipt of AuthorizeRequest, the CSMS responds with AuthorizeResponse. This response
message indicates whether or not the IdTokenType is accepted by the CSMS, and reports the EV
Driver-specific tariff in the personalMessage field.
**4.** The Charging Station shows the EV Driver-specific tariff to the EV Driver.
Alternative scenario(s) I04 - Show Fallback Tariff Information
**5 Prerequisite(s)** The Charging Station supports Tariff Information

**6 Postcondition(s)** (^) **Successful postcondition:**
The EV Driver is authorized, knows which tariff is applicable for him/her and can start charging.
**Failure postcondition:**
If the authorization status is other than _Accepted_ , the EV Driver can _not_ start and might not know
the tariff.

**7 Error Handling n/a
8 Remarks** (^) The tariff information presented this way might be equal to any token presented.
If known, and applicable, it is advisable to show the tariff information in a language understood by
the EV Driver.
It is advisable to give the driver the option to cancel the transaction when he does not agree with
the tariff. This could be not plugging in the cable, or a cancel button in the user interface etc. As
long at it is clear to the driver how a transaction can be canceled.

7 Error Handling n/a
8 Remarks If the Charging Station was offline when the transaction ended and the
TransactionEventResponse with totalCost is received when the Charging Station comes back
online some time after that, then there is no use in displaying the cost, because the user has likely
left already. A similar situation applies when TxStopPoint is defined as ParkingBayOccupancy,
in which case the EV must leave the Charging Station to cause the transaction to end.


The scenario description and sequence diagram above are based on the Configuration Variable
for stop transaction being configured as follows.
TxStopPoint: ParkingBayOccupancy, EVConnected, Authorized
This use-case is also valid for other configurations, but then the transaction might stop at another
moment, which might change the sequence in which message are send. For more details see the
use case: E06 - Stop Transaction options

**I03 - Show EV Driver Final Total Cost After Charging - Requirements**


ID. Precondition Requirements
I03.FR.01 When transaction is stopped The Charging Station SHALL send a TransactionEventRequest

The CSMS SHALL send the total cost of the transaction in the
totalCost field of the TransactionEventResponse message.
I03.FR.03 (^) I03.FR.02 AND
Charging Station was online when transaction
stopped
The Charging Station SHALL display the total cost to the EV
Driver.
I03.FR.04 To indicate a free transaction, the CSMS SHALL set _totalCost_ to
0.00. Thus omitting _totalCost_ does not imply that the transaction
was free.
I03.FR.05 (^) I02.FR.02 AND

==== I06 - Update Tariff Information During Transaction


No. Type Description
1 Name Update Tariff Information During Transaction
2 ID I06
Functional block I. Tariff and Cost
3 Objectives To show an EV Driver updated tariff information during a transaction.
4 Description During charging (especially DC fast charging) it might be useful to show the EV driver updated
tariff information when it becomes available.
Example: If a tariff has a bandwidth:
charging will cost between 0,25 and 0,40 euro/kWh depending on current energy price. Current
price is 0,28 euro/kWh.
Then when the price changing, this tariff information needs to be updated:
charging will cost between 0,25 and 0,40 euro/kWh depending on current energy price. Current
price is 0,32 euro/kWh.
Scenario description 1. The Charging Station sends TransactionEventRequest (eventType  Updated) messages during
the transaction.

**2.** When the CSMS receives a TransactionEventRequest message it checks if there is updated
tariff information available.
**3.** The CSMS acknowledges with a TransactionEventResponse message, which contains the
updated tariff information if available.

**5 Prerequisites** (^) The Charging Station supports Tariff Information
There is a transaction ongoing
**6 Postcondition(s)** (^) **Successful postcondition:**
The updated tariff information is shown to the EV Driver.
**Failure postcondition:**
The EV Driver has not been shown the updated tariff information.
